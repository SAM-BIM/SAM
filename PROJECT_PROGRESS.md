# Project Progress

## Branch
`feature/partf-terminal-transfer-compliance` (PR: SAM#73 against `sow/2026-Q3`)

## Last updated
2026-08-20 - final pre-merge review pass: rounds 1-2 Codex backlog re-triaged against current source;
three further correctness fixes applied; full suites re-run.

## Current status
Eight Codex findings implemented with regression tests. The TAS availability schedule export has PASSED
licensed acceptance (see below), so the Part O schedule foundation is proven end to end and the earlier
acceptance-failure hypothesis is withdrawn. Three behaviour/policy findings are explicitly DEFERRED for a
dedicated decision and are deliberately not part of this work.
Full `SAM.Tests`: **1344 passed, 0 failed** (Debug and Release; was 1341, +3 new in the final pass).

## Completed (this session)
- `Core.Query.TryGetEnum`: case-insensitive enum fallback made culture-invariant (`ToUpperInvariant`) -
  under a Turkish culture `"nightclosed"` previously uppercased with a dotted capital I and was silently
  rejected, so `SAMAnalytical.AddOpeningPropertiesByPartO` substituted `Unrestricted`. (Codex 3819617732)
- `VentilationStrategyMap`: the same defect class - strategy normalisation is now `ToUpperInvariant`, so
  a lowercase "disp" no longer reads as an unrecognised strategy under a Turkish culture.
  (Codex 3802695368)
- `DailyAvailabilitySchedule.FromJsonObject`: each `Values` element must be a genuine JSON boolean
  (`JsonValue` + `TryGetValue<bool>`); a string/number/null element now fails deserialization cleanly
  instead of `GetValue<bool>()` throwing out of the load. (Codex 3821025633)
- `PartOOpeningProperties.FromJsonObject`: a PRESENT but unrecognised `OpeningRestriction` name fails
  deserialization (via `TryGetEnum`) instead of silently reading as `Unrestricted`; the ABSENT key keeps
  meaning `Unrestricted`, which is the correct legacy behaviour. (Codex 3815926714)
- `PartFPurgeAssessor`: a non-finite provided opening area (NaN/infinity) is `CannotBeDetermined` instead
  of falling through the NaN comparisons to PASS. (Codex 3821633858)
- `Modify.AddTransferAirDoorsByPartF`: `doors_Created` now returns the PERSISTED aperture (re-read from
  the cluster after `SetPartFDoorTransferData`'s replacement), so the returned door carries the
  `PartFDoorTransferData` record like the door in the returned model. (Codex 3820935573)
- `Modify.ApplyPartFVentilationRates`: the generated-name set is seeded from every EXISTING
  internal-condition name, so a clone can no longer collide with an untouched condition whose name already
  matches the `<condition> - <space>` pattern (TAS identifies conditions by name). (Codex 3821025626)
- `TMOverheatingCalculator.Collect`: an hour is assessed only where BOTH comfort bounds exist, never
  against the `IndexedDoubles` default of 0. The comfort series is bounded by the weather year
  (365 days = 8760 hours), so an 8784-hour leap-year simulation previously assessed its last 24 hours
  against a 0 degC comfort limit and manufactured exceedances. (Codex 3821025624)
- `SAMAnalyticalCheckPartFCompliance`: `extractAllocationStrategy_` now guards with `Enum.IsDefined` like
  the operating-mode branch below it, so numeric text such as "9" is refused instead of selecting an
  undocumented hybrid allocation. (Codex 3796859272)
- `SAMAnalyticalPreparePartOIteration`: the BasePassive restriction-reset lines are ALSO raised as GH
  runtime warnings, not only on the `notes` output, so the reset is visible on the canvas rather than
  buried in a list output.

## Final pre-merge pass (this session) - backlog triage and fixes

The rounds 1-2 Codex backlog (17-19 Aug) was re-triaged against current source. Every thread now has a
classification. Implemented in this pass:

- `TMOverheatingCalculator.Collect`: the loop is bounded by the SHORTER of the two hourly series. A
  truncated resultant-temperature series previously threw `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` out of the whole
  TM52/TM59 run. (Codex 3796859276)
- `TM59AssessmentCalculator.RestoreDesignInternalConditions`: the design condition is restored onto a COPY
  of each simulated space, never onto the caller's instance - the cluster getter's shallow copy shares
  Space objects, so the previous in-place assignment contaminated the caller's raw simulation model.
  (Codex 3811381358)
- `TMOverheatingCalculator.Evaluate`: TM59 space applications are classified from the model's own restored
  space (`space_Temp`), not the stale listed instance - explicitly scoped assessments receive the map's
  retained pre-restore spaces, which selected the wrong TM59 result type or corridor fallback.
  (Codex 3804690049)
- `SAMAnalyticalSetPartFCommissioningData`: a `_zoneName` matching more than one zone is refused rather
  than resolved to the first, so commissioning evidence can no longer be written to the wrong dwelling.
  (Codex 3796737963)
- `SAM_PartFSpaceRulesUKDwellingsMVHR.json`: removed the stale claim that a kitchen's 13 l/s Table 1.2
  minimum can raise the continuous design rate (the code sets it to max(bedroom-or-habitable, area) only),
  in the migration note and the two formula strings. (Codex 3803896492)

## TAS availability schedule export - licensed acceptance PASSED
The schedule foundation is proven on the licensed TAS PC against SAM_Tas `7ef2aff3`:

- 20 schedules requested, **20 assigned**, **0 assignment or persistence warnings**.
- `PartO_DayOpen_08_23` visually correct in TAS: 00:00-08:00 OFF, 08:00-23:00 ON, 23:00-24:00 OFF.
- Slot 24 verified separately with `openingHour = 23`, `closingHour = 24`.

The root cause was the TAS adapter's schedule mapping, fixed in SAM_Tas: TBD's hourly indexed properties
are 1-based hour-ending (SAM hour `h` -> TBD slot `h + 1`), and COM hands VARIANT_BOOL TRUE back as -1.

The earlier "BasePassive reset" acceptance-failure hypothesis recorded here is **withdrawn** - it was not
the defect. `Modify.ResetPartOOpeningRestrictions` behaves as designed; the GH warnings added above remain
useful for reading a BasePassive run, but they are diagnostics, not a fix.

## Deferred - valid findings NOT implemented here
These are behaviour/policy changes that alter reported outcomes. They need a dedicated decision and must
not be folded into a review-fix commit.

- **Codex 3815926703 - zero occupied-hour TM59 spaces.** Technically valid concern, but changing the
  behaviour from an assessment result to a refusal changes report outcomes and requires a dedicated TM59
  policy decision. (Today: a naturally ventilated space with no occupied hour reads zero exceedances as a
  PASS, and a bedroom's Criterion 2 passes 0 against a limit of 0; a mechanically ventilated one reads
  `0 < 0` as a FAIL.)
- **Codex 3821633849 - Criterion 1 annual vs summer basis.** `TM59AssessmentReport` pairs the ANNUAL
  `GetOccupiedHoursExceedingComfortRange()` with the SUMMER limit and basis, while `Pass` derives from the
  annual count against the annual `MaxExceedableHours`, so a row can show an actual above its displayed
  limit and still read Pass. Confirmed real. Filtering the actual and the verdict to summer would change
  pass/fail for every naturally ventilated space (annual 262 against TAS's own 110 on the Flat1
  BasePassive reference), so it is a regulatory decision, not a review fix.
- **Codex 3802695375 - `successful` is true when no scenarios are produced.** `successful` is
  `refusals.Count == 0`, and a model with no zones adds only a warning. That case is deliberately
  supported - a single-house model carries no zones - so requiring at least one scenario would flip a
  supported configuration to failure. Needs a decision on what `successful` should mean.

D2 (aperture matching) and D3 (schedule-removal transition, Codex 3821601792) remain parked. **No D2 or
D3 code exists in this repository or in SAM_Tas.**

## Validation
- Focused runs for the retained fixes: 12/12 passed.
- Full `SAM.Tests` Debug: **1341 passed, 0 failed** (was 1329; +12 new).
- Full `SAM.Tests` Release: **1341 passed, 0 failed**.
- Final pass: focused TM59 runs 19/19, then full `SAM.Tests` Debug **1344 passed, 0 failed** and
  Release **1344 passed, 0 failed**.
- `SAM.Analytical.Grasshopper` and `SAM.Analytical` compile with 0 CS errors; `SAM.Analytical.Grasshopper`
  post-build deploy step fails locally with the pre-existing `*Undefined*` xcopy quirk (environmental -
  CI uses `RunPostBuildEvent=OnOutputUpdated` and is green).

## Issues / blockers
- None blocking. The deferred findings above are the outstanding decisions.
- Fresh Codex review on the current head is unavailable: `@codex review` is refused by
  `chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]` ("create a Codex account and connect to github"). The delta after the
  latest Codex-reviewed SHA (`9b4e46fe`) was reviewed manually. GitHub reports every Codex thread as
  unresolved because the bot never resolves them - every thread is now triaged here.

## Next step
- Merge PR #73, then SAM_Systems #14, SAM_Tas #29, SAM_Tas_Grasshopper #4 (dependency chain).
- Decide the deferred findings (3815926703, 3821633849, 3802695375 and the DEFERRED POLICY set above)
  as a TM59/Part O policy pass on the NEXT branch.
